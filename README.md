# RAMP Webapp

A web-based client application for connecting to a [RAMP server](https://github.com/mattprice/RAMP-Server), adjusting equalizer functions, and then listening to the results, which are streamed back from the server in realtime.

## Generating Waveforms

Waveforms can be generated with the [Waveform Ruby gem](https://github.com/benalavi/waveform) using the following command, where WIDTH should be equal to the track length (in seconds) multiplied by 30 (pixels):

```
waveform -W<WIDTH> -H55 -btransparent -c#ffffff <TRACK>.wav <TRACK>.png
```

In the future, waveforms should be generated by the server [using Java](http://www.green-creeper.com/?p=10) in combination with the [Waveform.js](http://waveformjs.org) library.
